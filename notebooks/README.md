# Notebooks
- all_particles_checks : checks comparing galaxy maps with **ALL** stellar particles vs. just friends-of-friends (**FOF**) particles 
   - `all_particles_compare_profiles.ipynb`: Comparing the stellar mass profiles 
   - `all_particles_check_individual_maps_profiles.ipynb`: Checking to see if the maps and stellar mass profiles of individual galaxies match up. Also save the profiles. 
   - `all_particles_fit_power_law.ipynb`: comparing fitting of power law to mass profile and extrapolating.
   - `all_particles_maps_tests.ipynb`: Initial exploration of new full particle data. Testing maps and profiles.
- `extrapolated_masses.ipynb`: measuring mass from a power law fit to mass profile extrapolated to larger distance.
- `extrapolated_masses_HSC-like.ipynb` : Using extrapolation to power law fits to measure mass for HSC-like sample of TNG galaxies
- `galaxy_edge.ipynb`: plotting mass profiles to large radii and compare with TNG300.
- `mass_checks_plots_for_paper.ipynb` : make mass comparison plots for paper.
- `mass_correction_factor.ipynb` : correlate M100/Mcat to various galaxy shape properties with the goal of deriving a correction factor that can be applied to M100 to derive catalog mass
- `measure_compare_mass_1d_2d.ipynb`: measuring 1D and 2D masses from mass profiles and maps and plotting comparisons.
